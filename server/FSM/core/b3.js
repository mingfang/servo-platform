/* Servo run-time is a Behavior Tree system written in JavaScript. It provides structures and algorithms that assist you in the task of creating intelligent agents for your AI application. Check it out some features
 * of Servo:
 *
 * - Based on the work of (Marzinotto et al., 2014), in which they propose a
 *   **formal**, **consistent** and **general** definition of Behavior Trees;
 * - **Optimized to control multiple agents**: you can use a single behavior
 *   tree instance to handle hundreds of agents;
 * - It was **designed to load and save trees in a JSON format**, in order to
 *   use, edit and test it in multiple environments, tools and languages;
